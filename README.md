## Overview

Hi, and welcome to my website ! I'm Paul Muller, a PhD Candidate at Deepmind (Via a CIFRE contract) at the Paris Office, and Universite Gustave Eiffel, advised by Professors Karl Tuyls, Romuald Elie and Viet-Chi Tran. My interests widely encompass the interactions between Multiagent Reinforcement Learning and Game Theory (Which include Mean-Field Games), real world applications thereof (eg. Economy), and AI ethics following a Straussian and MacIntyrian vision. Opinions are, of course, my own.

### Frequently Asked Questions

Given the increasing volume of questions I have been receiving from curious and enthusiastic students, the commonality of said questions, and my inability to self-duplicate,  I have come to the conclusion that the best way to scale my help is to provide answers to frequently asked questions in the open, so they may benefit the highest amount of people.  

- How did you find a position at Deepmind ?

Through, I must admit, sheer luck. I received a PhD offer from a French automotive company in Summer 2018, but had doubts regarding my future: I wanted to work on creating Intelligence, advancing our understanding of Humanity and the fundamentals operating our behavior. I expressed my doubts to Bilal Piot (Whom I had met once at a party at Supelec, and whom I must thank once again), a Deepmind Research Scientist, who confirmed them, advised me not to take the offer, and asked for my resume. The rest quickly came together, and after many interviews and nerve-wracks, here I was :) 


- I cannot see PhD offers at Deepmind, how comes ?

Unfortunately, Cifre PhDs have been frozen for the current future. If this track is one that could interest you (I would advise strongly considering it, as research isn't everyone's cup of tea - 99% perspiration, 1% results), do not hesitate to reach out to my advisors Karl Tuyls ([surname][name] at deepmind dot com) or Romuald Elie (relie at deepmind dot com). 


- Are you available for a call to discuss [non-research-project related questions] ?

When call requests were rare, I happily obliged, but given the current demand, accepting would necessarily mean selecting some people over others, or neglecting work, neither of which I am comfortable doing. The purpose of this section is to pre-emptively answer most questions that could be asked during such a call. If a question happened not to be answered here, don't hesitate to ask it to me, I will happily complete the website and send you my answer. (Many of these questions were asked to me during an October-question-surge)

- Are you available for a call to discuss [research-project related questions] ?

If the project is related to my interests - even only tenuously (Single-agent RL being among my interests) -, and I have free time, with pleasure !

- Can you recommend me ?

Unfortunately, if we haven't had the opportunity to work together, any recommendation from my part would be disingenuous, an attribute I attempt to avoid everywhere.
