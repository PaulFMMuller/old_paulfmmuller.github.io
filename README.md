## Overview

Hi, and welcome to my website ! I'm Paul Muller, a PhD Candidate at Deepmind (Via a CIFRE contract) at the Paris Office, and Universite Gustave Eiffel, advised by Professors Karl Tuyls, Romuald Elie and Viet-Chi Tran. My interests widely encompass the interactions between Multiagent Reinforcement Learning and Game Theory (Which include Mean-Field Games), real world applications thereof (eg. Economy), and AI ethics following a Straussian and MacIntyrian vision. Opinions are, of course, my own.


### Frequently Asked Questions

Given the increasing volume of questions I have been receiving from curious and enthusiastic students, the commonality of said questions, and my inability to self-duplicate,  I have come to the conclusion that the best way to scale my help is to provide answers to frequently asked questions in the open, so they may benefit the highest amount of people.  

- How did you find a position at Deepmind ?

Through, I must admit, sheer luck. I received a PhD offer from a French automotive company in Summer 2018, but had doubts regarding my future: I wanted to work on creating Intelligence, advancing our understanding of Humanity and the fundamentals operating our behavior. I expressed my doubts to Bilal Piot (Whom I had met at Supelec, and whom I must thank once again), a Deepmind Research Scientist, who confirmed them, advised me not to take the offer, and asked for my resume. The rest quickly came together, and after many interviews and nerve-wracks, here I was :) 


- How is it, doing a PhD at Deepmind ?

It's really great. Research is a sometimes difficult domain. One makes hypotheses that seem absolutely reasonable and intuitively true, attempts to verify and prove them, only to realize that - they're actually wrong ! Or worse - one can't quite manage to prove that they are right or wrong, proofs do not lead anywhere in either direction, and experiments are not informative ! Horrible ! But when things do work out, it's an extraordinary feeling. Deepmind facilitates these steps, by providing access to great environments, but first and foremost, to great people. Working at Deepmind means being surrounded by astoundingly competent, smart, driven, and most importantly, by astoundingly kind teammates. I couldn't wish for a better place to do a PhD.


- Would you recommend doing a PhD in general ?

This is a difficult question, and my answer will have to remain confined to my own domain. Even there, it will probably be heavily affected by my own vision of research, and shaped by my work ethic, my surroundings, my preferences, my chosen topics, and certainly many other factors. As written in the question just above, doing a PhD can, at times, be difficult.

A first step would be identifying why I chose to do a PhD. During my internship at Schlumberger in Beijing, under Francisco GÃ³mez and Cheolkyun (Charles) Jeong, I was initiated to research, and Cheolkyun often gently encouraged me to go towards research positions and apply for a PhD at his alma-mater, Stanford. Initially reluctant, as time grew by, the idea stuck, and by the end of 2017, I had decided I wanted to do a PhD. I discovered Reinforcement Learning, and decided it was time to make a choice, and that that one was as great as any, potentially even better than any ! I then started looking for one. After ~30 rejections (Including by Google Brain, OpenAI, Facebook, Ascent Robotics and Softbanks), I got a PhD offer from an automotive company, but at the same time, started interviewing with Deepmind. One must not live with regrets - I declined, with sadness, the automotive PhD offer to chase after the Deepmind one. While searching for a PhD, I worked on several research projects to improve my understanding of RL. 

I then stepped in to the world of research, an initially quite difficult one. 

One must learn to go beyond the (very strong) disappointment that comes with failed and early-aborted ideas, and the despair that accompanies relevance uncertainty of one's work (Since judging the quality of anyone's research is difficult, and it is very easy to under-evaluate one's own contributions, since they seem trivially obvious once they have been discovered / created, one can easily enter the terrible spiral of over-evaluating others' research ("What they're doing is so great, I could never do that !") and under-evaluating one's own research ("My work is so simple, barely worth any attention or credit :( "). The truth is - everyone feels like that at some point, and especially at the beginning of their research career ! Don't worry about it, your work is very likely to be novel and much more interesting than you suspect ! Speaking with other researchers about what you are doing is a great way to understand what you are doign in a deeper way, and get a better appreciation for its complexity and interest !) and domain choice uncertainty (Will my domain be "the right one" ? It's impossible to know in advance, that's why we're doing research ! ;P Whatever you do, provided it pushes the boundaries of knowledge, will have value in the world of research :) )

These obstacles are difficult to go beyond. Many people prefer aborting their research careers because they are not comfortable with them, and I have full empathy with them - these obstacles are (arguably a big) part of the bad side of doing research, and if the good side thereof doesn't make up for this bad side (Which is a very personal appreciation), then one should, in a very utilitarian way, find a domain that will have higher happiness-providing properties.

All that being said, I would argue that, if one enjoys the good side of doing research (ie. when things work !), going beyond these obstacles is worth every effort. It guides one from the chrysalid of a young adult into the butterfly of an accomplished (Or soon-accomplished) researcher. A beautiful human experience.


- Would you have advice on finding a Reinforcement-Learning PhD ?

This answer is mostly for French students. Our system is terrible. Other countries' students have almost all had an experience of research, seen how the academic system works, gotten in contact with many professors, etc. Almost none of that happens in France. Our system has been created by Napoleon during post-revolutionary times in order to facilitate the reconstruction of our country by quickly creating very competent engineers (Though it may have degenerated since then) - which means research is not our focus, being a good workforce is.

Times have obviously changed; yet I am not convinced that our Grandes Ecoles have.

To stop with this rant and be constructive, I would suggest one to attend the MVA, the master of Mathematiques Vision Apprentissage. This is where one will meet most RL researchers looking for PhD students, or able to recommend them. If that were not a possibility, then I strongly suggest doing research projects by oneself. There are many fascinating environments out there, such as Deepmind's OpenSpiel or the OpenAI Gym; and building your own environment can also be very rewarding ! (One of my research projects when I was looking for a PhD was using novelty-seeking behavior to unsupervisely learn how to play Dark Souls 2 - given low hardware capacity at the time, this was of course an utter failure, but a very instructive one !). Almost all research is available for free on Arxiv, including pseudo-algorithms that you can implement for libraries (Do contribute to OpenSpiel !). The only question is, what interests you ? Aside from exploration coupled with perhaps introspection (What do **I** want to accomplish with my research ? What are the most promising-looking ways to reach that objective ?), there's no good advice ! Once you identified an interesting area of specialization, a great way to contact this area's researchers is to, after gaining an understanding of their work, mention expansion or application areas that could be of interest, or new, related research directions. Even better would be providing results ! (Though don't forget to always protect your IP !)


- I cannot see PhD offers at Deepmind, how comes ?

Unfortunately, Cifre PhDs have been frozen for the current future. If this track is one that could interest you (I would advise strongly considering it, as research isn't everyone's cup of tea - 99% perspiration, 1% results), do not hesitate to reach out to my advisors Karl Tuyls ([surname][name] at deepmind dot com) or Romuald Elie (relie at deepmind dot com). 


- Do you know what Research Engineering interns do ?

I can't say anything more accurate than "work on research engineering projects"; there's a myriad of them at Deepmind, so each internship experience is unique !


- Are you available for a call to discuss [non-research-project related questions] ?

When call requests were rare, I happily obliged, but given the current demand, accepting would necessarily mean selecting some people over others, or neglecting work, neither of which I am comfortable doing. The purpose of this section is to pre-emptively answer most questions that could be asked during such a call. If a question happened not to be answered here, don't hesitate to ask it to me, I will happily complete the website and send you my answer. (Many of these questions were asked to me during an October-question-surge)

- Are you available for a call to discuss [research-project related questions] ?

If the project is related to my interests - even only tenuously (Single-agent RL being among my interests) -, and I have free time, with pleasure !

- Can you recommend me ?

Unfortunately, if we haven't had the opportunity to work together, any recommendation from my part would be disingenuous, an attribute I attempt to avoid everywhere.
