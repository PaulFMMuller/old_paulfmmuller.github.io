## Overview

Hi, and welcome to my website ! I'm Paul Muller, a PhD Candidate at Deepmind (Via a CIFRE contract) at the Paris Office, and Universite Gustave Eiffel, advised by Professors Karl Tuyls, Romuald Elie and Viet-Chi Tran. My interests widely encompass the interactions between Multiagent Reinforcement Learning and Game Theory (Which include Mean-Field Games), real world applications thereof (eg. Economy), and AI ethics following a Straussian and MacIntyrian vision. Opinions are, of course, my own.
